This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows.  * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"contracts/1_Storage.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"contracts/1_Storage.sol":{"keccak256":"0x4379f24fa32e3458292c125737dad1a8721274d1b8f8fb15e3a94790538f06cf","urls":["bzz-raw://b89f7326bc448dedf3ca8b043c0d5f98d8a99ed4f4497d9aff061b81ceb05726","dweb:/ipfs/QmfJfpmEDiJxWGWukJgffGvqER1YBhRNYkSQBNBYZFCyWi"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
