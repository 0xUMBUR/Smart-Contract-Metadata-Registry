Signed 64.64-bit fixed point number is basically a simple fraction whose numerator is signed 128-bit integer and denominator is 2^64.  As long as denominator is always the same, there is no need to store it, thus in Solidity signed 64.64-bit fixed point numbers are represented by int128 type holding only the numerator.","version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"abdk-libraries-solidity/ABDKMath64x64.sol":"ABDKMath64x64"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"abdk-libraries-solidity/ABDKMath64x64.sol":{"keccak256":"0x67609bc0923563d05d3a8a7c681056f9702a92120777cb0bcbb40d0afbb4a015","license":"BSD-4-Clause","urls":["bzz-raw://55e817969394d4e0201a8cd3763ad6776bc9fddc986febe9b4acf120e8b7ad0d","dweb:/ipfs/QmNMve5ZjUfA8DJYic4sYTrDEAN6VyxcC7jWUTX25Wmnnp"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
