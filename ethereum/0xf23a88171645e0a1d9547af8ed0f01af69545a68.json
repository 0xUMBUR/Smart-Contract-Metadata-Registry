This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xe60ef00b78935e1f780e702795c2a1aa5799e02e524c6aa145aa182bce50bb0d","urls":["bzz-raw://6b307d835baa5524c7a45d4d76b15fb1c9e137dd4ba19b7c9b1d63f4c707dd09","dweb:/ipfs/QmY8e7TZANjCnCsgdkbDK6KMurMzveGp6XZbrFvRsJaENr"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
