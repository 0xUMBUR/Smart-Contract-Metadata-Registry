This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/Carbon.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/Carbon.sol":{"keccak256":"0x2fc42a5c556e219c22182f3e1d00df613e33e522670fa8b350ccd07f37ef4d7c","urls":["bzz-raw://22f8db713383db18514d1a865c3e9339152539db5f64eb424f81de41e951bafb","dweb:/ipfs/QmUeUmWoeAfAfPckowV8ox3Jhiqekxc7JiRFjKHrGBkkbs"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
