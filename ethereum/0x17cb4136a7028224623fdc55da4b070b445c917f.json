This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows.  * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"petersburg","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xf18f5f0027ba4abcc41d2b57fe6a2892b6ba44db0f9cc19c25bb483c9b9347b5","urls":["bzz-raw://2308319cb18536ef64fc1fcb5d4c733d13f434d679950d4cb1bf5215d6398017","dweb:/ipfs/QmTD2bnTyUKbLN2VLJonbRHaXZVFBo46ZBgtBAeVEVvNLj"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
