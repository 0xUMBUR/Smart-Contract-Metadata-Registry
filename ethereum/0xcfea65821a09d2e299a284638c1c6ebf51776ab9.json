This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"contracts/PolySave.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"contracts/PolySave.sol":{"keccak256":"0x9213853b83231c3d7e01a242bc1c5930df7cfb296c42bd8153bc3d43dd544d8f","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://823ec649f31645cd8608b37de4685b722744752bf001c7982f1a8f2d56692302","dweb:/ipfs/QmSWstVsxsDRJTQEGEMyBABe7chq1UaoTPy8KiqxBKbhWX"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
