This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.0.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.0.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xaa0e11a791bc975d581a4f5b7a8d9c16a880a354c89312318ae072ae3e740409","urls":["bzz-raw://982d8b344f76193834260436d74c81e5a8f9e89106bb4cd72bbaabda4f3f59c2","dweb:/ipfs/QmSrvP5TkQRhKDVCTpsV3uaKLBhkt7PjUY89vdtM9o5ybK"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
