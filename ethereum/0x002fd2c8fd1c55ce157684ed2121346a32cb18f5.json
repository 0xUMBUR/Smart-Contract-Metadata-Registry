To use it, replace the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier. WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance. WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent, because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.","methods":{},"title":"Initializable"},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"contracts/bhnk.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":90},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"contracts/bhnk.sol":{"keccak256":"0x822faef4ebd6ea6dc51baca10fc858d233722e0c6330121e754e654013ac79d0","urls":["bzz-raw://3d382c91d7c636764176e8a19bf9979981e301300892710fc9b060918565057d","dweb:/ipfs/QmP35zr2T8WZ24hrVQ3GXbsfPZ5cWGgMTpSFVDXydStt53"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
