This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xcc78a17dd88fa5a2edc60c8489e2f405c0913b377216a5b26b35656b2d0dab52","urls":["bzz-raw://526dc85e1f9b9b45830e202568d267d93dde7a4fcccf4ad7798dadcd92304d3c","dweb:/ipfs/QmaoXMB972J3cSDLtBq3xBo4jLwqD2uzXTwujtSPqkYVhR"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
