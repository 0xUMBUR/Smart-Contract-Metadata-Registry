To use it, replace the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier. WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance. WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent, because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.","methods":{},"title":"Initializable"},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/Debase.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/Debase.sol":{"keccak256":"0x42c121fea68b77331a8143a949a150eb5369bf3c92be798f3eb91fb79451757e","urls":["bzz-raw://e810feb5435b1ee2160c079c2255e8f74b4db6f8fdca846a676d70c922115991","dweb:/ipfs/QmT8sDshUaB4UFn6U7XsAk8Htdsyr5Gu9VA9xNFjL5RNCb"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
