This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/61973af29f469e62dadf9df239699175d5bee95e/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/61973af29f469e62dadf9df239699175d5bee95e/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x6c6170814b42cd45c2c241af7a1aa90bc82fbb5b6f09f10f6e0b0e28b48e0d29","urls":["bzz-raw://6394a4d24ccb60f0bef2ab7f100139d423ac3292aa47b68202c9f83d106e3c29","dweb:/ipfs/QmYa2DQvXo9GnpZNX8XQUxeZc8UM6y4xMzVoZZeAzbnWda"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
