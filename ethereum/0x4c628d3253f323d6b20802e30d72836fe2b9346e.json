Signed 64.64-bit fixed point number is basically a simple fraction whose numerator is signed 128-bit integer and denominator is 2^64.  As long as denominator is always the same, there is no need to store it, thus in Solidity signed 64.64-bit fixed point numbers are represented by int128 type holding only the numerator."}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"contracts/TestInc.sol":"ABDKMath64x64"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"contracts/TestInc.sol":{"keccak256":"0xab6a73a232d7a7a99faf06af28820e21856e4479e57632b0a19c6b9ad23c1662","urls":["bzz-raw://20f2a1483ee51bd54d6bd6a9fa28eadd99a14e58870680a2acd81e65e8af0e5f","dweb:/ipfs/QmVj6n9XJXq2tu1Nz2nd5vHKgxFp8Mki2sgybhUgHnm5es"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
