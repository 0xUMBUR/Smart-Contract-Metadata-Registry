This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"petersburg","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x220702b2e85af8358cd16b53c9f95766e4c7f4de7a112e468c84eedacdef8e44","urls":["bzz-raw://f6f702a75ec2baebe0ed48902b18c03a1c19e93a691f0f70ab8c1c37ca87baad","dweb:/ipfs/QmaY4R7BMgnf3EkFvz53WtJWWdAPkUC5vKMzeo8KJ1JqQz"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
