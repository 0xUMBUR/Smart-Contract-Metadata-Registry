This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows.  * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"Maths/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"Maths/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0xfed5d4b018e3aa90ef91724cca270d23913ece085bbe466f30e2ccaaf52d771e","urls":["bzz-raw://3d3c272a67125de37b068fc329b003c300c7b6f28713486c36f2a99f9d84521b","dweb:/ipfs/QmNfXptd5Lc6p6j4wMZtyabeB9auRKUwkb72zcSkmHjHAv"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
