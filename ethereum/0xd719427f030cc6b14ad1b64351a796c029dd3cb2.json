Typically used in a 2-of-3 signing configuration. Uses ecrecover to allow for 2 signatures in a single transaction. The first signature is created on the operation hash (see Data Formats) and passed to the multiSig functions The signer is determined by verifyMultiSig(). The second signature is created by the submitter of the transaction and determined by msg.signer. This wallet only allows for three signers that have to be set upon deployment. The signers cannot be changed/removed/added. This iteration of the wallet restricts the initiation of the different functions to specific signers, and removes the expiryTime param, and removes events. Signer Authorisation ==================== All multisig transactions can only be initiated by the 3rd Signer AKA The Custodian Data Formats ============ The signature is created with ethereumjs-util.ecsign(operationHash). Like the eth_sign RPC call, it packs the values as a 65-byte array of [r, s, v]. Unlike eth_sign, the message is not prefixed. The operationHash the result of keccak256(prefix, hash). For Issue transactions, `prefix` is \"ISSUE\". For Bulk Issue transactions, `prefix` is \"BULKISSUE\". For Revoke transaction, `prefix` is \"REVOKE\". For Bulk Revoke transaction, `prefix` is \"BULKREVOKE\". For Transfer transaction, 'prefix' is \"TRANSFER\" For Change transaction, 'prefix' is \"CHANGE\"","version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/AccredifyMultiSigDocStore.sol":"AccredifyMultiSigDocStore"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/AccredifyMultiSigDocStore.sol":{"keccak256":"0xf3ed322742c36629fa6f7c72a148f44e9502541cdeb30c1cf119f3a37ce652bf","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://c74fed4bc93e544c8e9469d36149cb6d1053fa1b405226cf591dc77d95b886b6","dweb:/ipfs/QmTCkVUjqeEgHZRa1U1H1cLx4xEqCCxnATMJbtRQLNiVbL"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
