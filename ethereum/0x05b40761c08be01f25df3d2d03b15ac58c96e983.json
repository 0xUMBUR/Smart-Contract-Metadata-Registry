This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{".deps/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"homestead","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{".deps/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x28ceab6aa54cf0fdc92a20ccda524c3438c26e60eb6aa48d2462072f36e96df5","urls":["bzz-raw://75f2518102ef56c8801de6e858bc3577df22dfcad93b3ba8007e54dae0df1a03","dweb:/ipfs/QmU1tWKMCbmYo6jBCPodFuKH61LmMxDCRhAvvdCSFP7RS1"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
