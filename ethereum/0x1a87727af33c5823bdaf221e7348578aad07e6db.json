This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"ok.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"ok.sol":{"keccak256":"0xe39dc987fe9c07872385ddcaa8b71283dd9db7543bb2b07f668f3e129a3cb2b7","urls":["bzz-raw://51c9d5dc6e345b64078824c52520e82f4e602da602b4d27f70d99f09677aed3c","dweb:/ipfs/QmTNjDuz4pweFZqzp3JaXkoMJKfqdDpH9qPVtJfsJMtz3V"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
