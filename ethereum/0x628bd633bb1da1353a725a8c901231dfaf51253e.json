Depof Token Depof Token is a price-reactive store of value cryptocurrency. That is, the inflation rate of the token is wholly dependent on its market activity. Minting does not happen when the price is less than the day prior. When the price is greater than the day prior, the inflation for that day is a function of its price, percent increase, volume, any positive price streaks, and the amount of time any given holder has been holding.
