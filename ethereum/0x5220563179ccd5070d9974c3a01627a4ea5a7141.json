This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"Whitepaper.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"Whitepaper.sol":{"keccak256":"0x476809c20f8203ec12a39823fb4418c58f18485300d106d7171ccce7cfd3c9a3","urls":["bzz-raw://8b91eed7ef9b5c3d747e0d602150eaa93c11f81105e3c38a46db658820030d14","dweb:/ipfs/QmNbVhZWprhAWsjsBNtp1qo2fNLqc9QEDNoYYfPtL3k4qN"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
